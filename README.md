# python-data-structures-and-algorithms
An object oriented implementation of a few common data structures that I worked on through the Udemy course \
Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises by Scott Barrett. I am also adding functions/methods that I used to solve\
leetcode style questions to corresponding data structures such as the max_depth method in the binary search tree.
